A program, in which you can create a Hospital. There are doctors(giving diagoneses to patients) and nurses(giving medicines to patients). There are 3 different departments. For every department, there are 10 rooms and 3 beds in every room. If some patient "wants" to join to a hospital, there are validations like: which gender is, if it is (for example) woman, then comes the next validation for a room, which is only for women or empty room. When he/she leave the hospital, the bed becomes empty, and if there is no more patients in a room, the room's male/female status is null. Using Lists.
